Beckett is a weird Markov Chain based text generator that I made and decided to share here.

Made in the Godot Game Engine, easy to import through there or through copying code into python (GDScript translates almost directly).


The main code for it is in TextGen.gd

To provide an input, put a text file (.txt) in the "text" folder. By default, it should work to generate sentences based on any paragraphs or sentences provided in input files.
You can also provide multiple inputs at once in the text folder, so you could combine any sources you'd like.
